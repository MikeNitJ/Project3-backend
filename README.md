Backend README (for User Authentication and Spotify API)
Beginner's Guide to Building a Backend with User Authentication and Spotify API Integration
Welcome to the backend development project for beginner developers! In this project, you will learn how to create a backend server with user authentication and integrate the Spotify API to handle songs and playlists.

Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you have the following:
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and Node.js.
- A code editor installed on your computer (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
- Node.js and npm installed.
- Familiarity with Git for version control (optional).

Getting Started
1. Clone or download the project repository from GitHub Repository Link.
2. Open the project in your code editor.

Features
This backend project includes the following features:
- User authentication (user model and authentication logic).
- Integration with the Spotify API to fetch songs.
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on playlists and songs.
- A search bar functionality.

Implementation Steps
1. Setting Up the Environment: Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already. Set up a Node.js project and install necessary dependencies using npm install.
2. User Authentication: Implement user authentication using a library like Passport.js or a dedicated authentication service like Firebase Authentication.
3. Spotify API Integration: Register your application on the Spotify Developer Dashboard (https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) to get API credentials. Use a library like node-spotify-api (https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-node) to interact with the Spotify API in your backend.
4. Database Setup: Set up a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to store user data, playlists, and songs. Use an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) or a NoSQL library to interact with the database.
5. CRUD Operations: Implement CRUD operations for playlists and songs, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete their playlists and songs.
6. Search Functionality: Implement a search bar that allows users to search for songs and add them to their playlists.
7. Testing: Test your backend API endpoints thoroughly to ensure they work correctly.
8. Deployment: If desired, deploy your backend server to a cloud hosting service like Heroku or AWS.
